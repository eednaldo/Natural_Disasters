	<h3> Proposal </h3>
	<p> When I started my planning to come to the United States, a particular concern arose regarding climate and natural disasters such as earthquakes, 
			hurricanes, snowstorms, maximum and minimum temperatures, etc. </p> 
	<p>Finding all this information in one place and being able to analyze how relevant and how often these events occur is not an easy task, 
			especially since these events cannot be predicted, or at least not well in advance. We can only get an idea by analyzing historical data.</p> 
	<p>In my case, I searched for information on Google from city to city. </p>
	<p>This project intends to provide information using historical data on natural disasters in the United States. 
		Also, do some analysis comparing the states with each other.</p>
	<p>Some questions that I want to answer or provide information for the user to make their own decisions are what types of natural disasters occur in certain places, 
		how often, how badly, and how bad they are compared to other regions in the country.</p>
		
	<h3> Datasets used </h3>
	<h4> bigquery-public-data:noaa_hurricanes </h4>
			<p> Overview: The historical positions and intensities along the tracks of global tropical cyclones (TC) are provided by NOAAâ€™s International Best Track Archive for 
				Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS). Tropical Cyclones are known as hurricanes in the north Atlantic and northeast Pacific ocean basins, typhoons in the northwest 
				Pacific ocean basin, cyclones in the north and south Indian Ocean basins, and tropical cyclones in the southwest Pacific ocean basin. 
				TCs endanger millions annually in those coastal regions. IBTrACS collects data about TCs reported by international monitoring centers who have a responsibility to 
				forecast and report on TCs (and also includes some important historical datasets). Presently, IBTrACS includes data from 9 different countries. Historically, 
				the data describing these systems has included best estimates of their track and intensity (hence the term, best track). Update frequency: Daily</p>
	<h4> bigquery-public-data:noaa_historic_severe_storms </h4>
			<p> Overview: The Storm Events Database is an integrated database of severe weather events across the United States from 1950 to this year, 
				with information about a storm event's location, azimuth, distance, impact, and severity, including the cost of damages to property and crops. 
				It contains data documenting: The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, 
				significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce. Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida 
				or the San Diego coastal area. Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with 
				another event. Update frequency: Monthly</p>
	<h4> bigquery-public-data:noaa_significant_earthquakes </h4>
			<p>According to the National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI): <br>
				"The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 2150 B.C. to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: 
				Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, 
				Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami."
			<p>National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): Significant Earthquake Database. National Geophysical Data Center, NOAA. doi:10.7289/V5TD9V7K</p>
	<h4> bigquery-public-data:geo_us_boundaries</h4>
	<p> These are full-resolution boundary files, derived from TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the fully-supported, core geographic products from the US Census Bureau. 
			They are extracts of selected geographic and cartographic information from the US Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing 
			(MAF/TIGER) database.</p> 
			<p>These include information for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, 
				Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands). These include polygon boundaries of geographic and statistical areas, linear features including roads and hydrography, and point features.</p>
